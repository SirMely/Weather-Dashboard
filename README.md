# 🌤️ Weather Dashboard

A **simple but clean weather app** that lets you **search for a city and get real-time weather updates**.

Built with **React + OpenWeather API**, this project was made to **practice API integration, state management, and clean UI design**.

Also I can finally be more vocal while coding!

## 📝 Why I Made This?
I wanted to build something **useful** but also a **solid portfolio project** that shows:
✅ **Fetching data from an API (OpenWeather)**
✅ **Using React hooks (`useState`) to manage UI updates**
✅ **Making the UI look clean & responsive**
